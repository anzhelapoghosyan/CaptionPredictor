# GroupProjectWorldProg
Group Project for Intro to the World of Programming

Who is the user of my product?

AUA students, AUA alumni, AUA prospective students


Why does the audience need my product?

Mostly for entertainment purposes. However, this is a stepping stone, which will be used to predict preferences for captions in the future.


When do I need it by?

By the end of the semester when the project is due :D


What is it that we're trying to build?

In the scope of our World of Programming project, the four of us gathered around to make efforts for some fellow social media users and provide their pictures with creative and on-point captions. As opposed to the project itself, we are focusing on a chosen sample, which feautures around 100 pictures taken and tagged in the AUA area, so we can predict what is the user most likely to caption his/her picture. In particular, we analyzed the aforementioned sample and broke the pictures down to some criterion, such as the occasion of the pictures, the gender of the person in the picture, amount of people involved in the picture and some other decision-makers. Submitting all this information and executing it as a code already creates a reliable piece of data that can help us predict: what is any other user most likely to caption his/her picture according to the decision-making metrics.


How do we build it?

The program will be written in Python. There will be a model for predicting the characteristics of a caption, based on the existing dataset.
